# CreditAnalytics

This a credit analytic project based on the Lending Club's data.

It includes two code implementation files: 
Part I includes all the data cleaning processes (2 million samples with 148 variables), feature selection based on IV and WoE, the logistic regressions to estimate PD with LASSO regurization, and the construction of the credit scorecard. 

Part II includes LGD models trained using random forest and XGBoosting with optimal parameters tuned by cross-validation.

All the modelling results are validated and compared using F-measure, ROC curve, AUROC, MSE, accuracies, etc.

The report summerizes above implementation methdologies and final results.
